You must create a database (3 points) for an electronic agenda. The database must handle appointments for multiple users. Each user has a name, a password and a list of 
appointments. Each appointment has a date, a duration, a location (text) and a subject.
A user can share an appointment with other users from the database. An appointment can be shared with a user only once (no duplicates should be allowed).

Create the following:

	1. A script that will add 100 users and 1000 appointments. Each user must have 10 appointments. (2 points)
	2. Create a procedure that receives as a parameter an appointment and a user. The procedure will share the appointment with the user if the 	
           sharing does not already exist. (1 point)
	3. Denormalize by adding a column "NoOfShared" to the users table. The column should always contain the number of appointments shared 	
           with that user.
		a). Modify procedure from 2 in order to compute the "NoOfShared" column. (1 point)
		b). Add transactions to ensure the database does not enter an inconsistent state. See the smallest isolation level that 			
                       guarantees that "NoOfShared" is always consistent. (1 point)
	4. Create a sql statement that returns the number of appointments for 
	a given user. Make sure the query uses an index seek. (1 point)
